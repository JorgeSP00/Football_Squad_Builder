Application that enables users to create custom football squads. Users will choose players for their squad, each of whom has attributes such as market value, usual playing position, nationality, and the team they belong to. Based on this data (nationality, team, and market value), a set of limitations can be defined, which the user must follow when constructing their squad. By adhering to these limitations, users aim to build the best possible team, and other users can rate the quality of these squads.
